About:
------
I forked this theme to make some changes and fixes. The goal of the fork is to fix the theme, not to implement new features.

This theme is originally based on G.A.N.T. by Oscar Carlsson and 
is inspired by the well-known Media Center theme.

I found the MythTVMediaCenterOSD osd theme by Jason Gabriele to go best 
with this theme, but of course this is merely a matter of taste. 
Maybe I will do an OSD theme in the future too.
